SQL Sales & Customer Analytics Project
Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end SQL analytics workflow using a simulated retail business database. The goal was to design relational tables, generate realistic transactional data, and extract business insights using SQL queries.

Database Structure

The project uses a relational schema consisting of:

customers – customer details and locations

orders – purchase transactions

products – product catalog and pricing

order_items – product-level order records

These tables are connected using primary and foreign keys to simulate a real-world sales environment.

Data Preparation

Synthetic data was generated to mimic real business transactions. Basic data cleaning and structuring were applied to ensure consistency across relationships.

Key SQL Concepts Used

SELECT statements

INNER JOIN (multi-table joins)

Aggregation functions (SUM, COUNT)

GROUP BY & ORDER BY

CASE WHEN (customer segmentation)

Date functions for trend analysis

Business Insights Generated

Total revenue calculation

Monthly revenue trends

Best-selling products

Customer spending segmentation (High, Medium, Low value)

Tools & Technologies

MySQL

SQL (Data Querying & Analysis)

Project Objective

To demonstrate practical SQL skills for real-world data analytics, including relational database design, data manipulation, and business insight generation.

Future Improvements

Connect database to Power BI/Tableau for visualization

Expand dataset for deeper trend analysis

Implement advanced SQL analytics (window functions, customer retention)
